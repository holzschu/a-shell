# Customizable toolbar: 
# Each button is defined by its icon (first column), the action to be executed when the button is clicked (second column) and a parameter for that action (third column).

# Icons can be either the name of one of the SF Symbols from Apple: https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/ or a string of characters.
# Action can be either "insertString", "systemAction" or "insertCommand"

# The effect of the parameter depends on the action:
# - for insertString, it can be any string, and will be inserted when you type the button. 
#					  Strings can contain \n, so you can execute commands, even multiple commands.
# - for systemAction, it can be any of: control, up, down, left, right, cut, copy or paste.
# - for insertCommand, it is a short command that will be executed when the button is pressed. 
#					  The output of this command will be inserted at the cursor position

# Groups are enclosed in brackets (see bottom of file for an example). 
# The part after the closing bracket is the representative item (icon or text, can be nil). 
# If space is constrained, iPadOS will display the group as a submenu using that item,
# if it's not nil (iOS will always display all buttons). 

# On iOS 16, groups can be made to appear depending on the command: after the opening bracket, you can
# add a regular expression. If that expression matches the current command, the buttons will 
# show. A special regexp ("none") is for buttons that should only appear if no commands are running.

# This file corresponds to the default toolbar: first the 4 buttons on the left (tab, control, escape, paste), 
# then a line with "separator" to indicate the separation between the two groups, 
# then the 4 arrow buttons on the right.
# To customize the toolbar, simply edit this file. To go back to the default toolbar, remove it.
