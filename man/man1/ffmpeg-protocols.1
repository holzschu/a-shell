ffmpeg\-protocols \- FFmpeg protocols
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes the input and output protocols provided by the
libavformat library.
.SH "PROTOCOL OPTIONS"
.IX Header "PROTOCOL OPTIONS"
The libavformat library provides some generic global options, which
can be set on all the protocols. In addition each protocol may support
so-called private options, which are specific for that component.
.PP
Options may be set by specifying \-\fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`AVFormatContext\*(C'\fR options or using the \fIlibavutil/opt.h\fR \s-1API\s0
for programmatic use.
.PP
The list of supported options follows:
.IP "\fBprotocol_whitelist\fR \fIlist\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "protocol_whitelist list (input)"
Set a \*(L",\*(R"\-separated list of allowed protocols. \*(L"\s-1ALL\*(R"\s0 matches all protocols. Protocols
prefixed by \*(L"\-\*(R" are disabled.
All protocols are allowed by default but protocols used by an another
protocol (nested protocols) are restricted to a per protocol subset.
.SH "PROTOCOLS"
.IX Header "PROTOCOLS"
Protocols are configured elements in FFmpeg that enable access to
resources that require specific protocols.
.PP
When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported protocols are
enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option \*(L"\-\-list\-protocols\*(R".
.PP
You can disable all the protocols using the configure option
\&\*(L"\-\-disable\-protocols\*(R", and selectively enable a protocol using the
option "\-\-enable\-protocol=\fI\s-1PROTOCOL\s0\fR\*(L", or you can disable a
particular protocol using the option
\&\*(R"\-\-disable\-protocol=\fI\s-1PROTOCOL\s0\fR".
.PP
The option \*(L"\-protocols\*(R" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported protocols.
.PP
All protocols accept the following options:
.IP "\fBrw_timeout\fR" 4
.IX Item "rw_timeout"
Maximum time to wait for (network) read/write operations to complete,
in microseconds.
.PP
A description of the currently available protocols follows.
.SS "amqp"
.IX Subsection "amqp"
Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (\s-1AMQP\s0) version 0\-9\-1 is a broker based
publish-subscribe communication protocol.
.PP
FFmpeg must be compiled with \-\-enable\-librabbitmq to support \s-1AMQP. A\s0 separate
\&\s-1AMQP\s0 broker must also be run. An example open-source \s-1AMQP\s0 broker is RabbitMQ.
.PP
After starting the broker, an FFmpeg client may stream data to the broker using
the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-re \-i input \-f mpegts amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]
.Ve
.PP
Where hostname and port (default is 5672) is the address of the broker. The
client may also set a user/password for authentication. The default for both
fields is \*(L"guest\*(R". Name of virtual host on broker can be set with vhost. The
default value is \*(L"/\*(R".
.PP
Muliple subscribers may stream from the broker using the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffplay amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]
.Ve
.PP
In RabbitMQ all data published to the broker flows through a specific exchange,
and each subscribing client has an assigned queue/buffer. When a packet arrives
at an exchange, it may be copied to a client's queue depending on the exchange
and routing_key fields.
.PP
The following options are supported:
.IP "\fBexchange\fR" 4
.IX Item "exchange"
Sets the exchange to use on the broker. RabbitMQ has several predefined
exchanges: \*(L"amq.direct\*(R" is the default exchange, where the publisher and
subscriber must have a matching routing_key; \*(L"amq.fanout\*(R" is the same as a
broadcast operation (i.e. the data is forwarded to all queues on the fanout
exchange independent of the routing_key); and \*(L"amq.topic\*(R" is similar to
\&\*(L"amq.direct\*(R", but allows for more complex pattern matching (refer to the RabbitMQ
documentation).
.IP "\fBrouting_key\fR" 4
.IX Item "routing_key"
Sets the routing key. The default value is \*(L"amqp\*(R". The routing key is used on
the \*(L"amq.direct\*(R" and \*(L"amq.topic\*(R" exchanges to decide whether packets are written
to the queue of a subscriber.
.IP "\fBpkt_size\fR" 4
.IX Item "pkt_size"
Maximum size of each packet sent/received to the broker. Default is 131072.
Minimum is 4096 and max is any large value (representable by an int). When
receiving packets, this sets an internal buffer size in FFmpeg. It should be
equal to or greater than the size of the published packets to the broker. Otherwise
the received message may be truncated causing decoding errors.
.IP "\fBconnection_timeout\fR" 4
.IX Item "connection_timeout"
The timeout in seconds during the initial connection to the broker. The
default value is rw_timeout, or 5 seconds if rw_timeout is not set.
.IP "\fBdelivery_mode\fR \fImode\fR" 4
.IX Item "delivery_mode mode"
Sets the delivery mode of each message sent to broker.
The following values are accepted:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBpersistent\fR" 4
.IX Item "persistent"
Delivery mode set to \*(L"persistent\*(R" (2). This is the default value.
Messages may be written to the broker's disk depending on its setup.
.IP "\fBnon-persistent\fR" 4
.IX Item "non-persistent"
Delivery mode set to \*(L"non-persistent\*(R" (1).
Messages will stay in broker's memory unless the broker is under memory
pressure.

.PP
The accepted options are:
.IP "\fBread_ahead_limit\fR" 4
.IX Item "read_ahead_limit"
Amount in bytes that may be read ahead when seeking isn't supported. Range is \-1 to \s-1INT_MAX.\s0
\&\-1 for unlimited. Default is 65536.
.PP

.PP
.Vb 1
\&        cache:<URL>
.Ve
.SS "concat"
.IX Subsection "concat"
Physical concatenation protocol.
.PP
Read and seek from many resources in sequence as if they were
a unique resource.
.PP
A \s-1URL\s0 accepted by this protocol has the syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        concat:<URL1>|<URL2>|...|<URLN>
.Ve
.PP
where \fI\s-1URL1\s0\fR, \fI\s-1URL2\s0\fR, ..., \fI\s-1URLN\s0\fR are the urls of the
resource to be concatenated, each one possibly specifying a distinct
protocol.
.PP
For example to read a sequence of files \fIsplit1.mpeg\fR,
\&\fIsplit2.mpeg\fR, \fIsplit3.mpeg\fR with \fBffplay\fR use the
command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\e|split2.mpeg\e|split3.mpeg
.Ve
.PP
Note that you may need to escape the character \*(L"|\*(R" which is special for
many shells.
.SS "concatf"
.IX Subsection "concatf"
Physical concatenation protocol using a line break delimited list of
resources.
.PP
Read and seek from many resources in sequence as if they were
a unique resource.
.PP
A \s-1URL\s0 accepted by this protocol has the syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        concatf:<URL>
.Ve
.PP
where \fI\s-1URL\s0\fR is the url containing a line break delimited list of
resources to be concatenated, each one possibly specifying a distinct
protocol. Special characters must be escaped with backslash or single
quotes. See \fBthe \*(L"Quoting and escaping\*(R"
section in the \fBffmpeg\-utils\fB\|(1) manual\fR.
.PP
For example to read a sequence of files \fIsplit1.mpeg\fR,
\&\fIsplit2.mpeg\fR, \fIsplit3.mpeg\fR listed in separate lines within
a file \fIsplit.txt\fR with \fBffplay\fR use the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffplay concatf:split.txt
.Ve
.PP
Where \fIsplit.txt\fR contains the lines:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        split1.mpeg
\&        split2.mpeg
\&        split3.mpeg
.Ve
.SS "crypto"
.IX Subsection "crypto"
AES-encrypted stream reading protocol.
.PP
The accepted options are:
.IP "\fBkey\fR" 4
.IX Item "key"
Set the \s-1AES\s0 decryption key binary block from given hexadecimal representation.
.IP "\fBiv\fR" 4
.IX Item "iv"
Set the \s-1AES\s0 decryption initialization vector binary block from given hexadecimal representation.
.PP
Accepted \s-1URL\s0 formats:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        crypto:<URL>
\&        crypto+<URL>
.Ve
.SS "data"
.IX Subsection "data"
Data in-line in the \s-1URI.\s0 See <\fBhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme\fR>.
.PP
For example, to convert a \s-1GIF\s0 file given inline with \fBffmpeg\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhCAAIAMIEAAAAAAAA//8AAP//AP///////////////ywAAAAACAAIAAADF0gEDLojDgdGiJdJqUX02iB4E8Q9jUMkADs=" smiley.png
.Ve
.SS "file"
.IX Subsection "file"
File access protocol.
.PP
Read from or write to a file.
.PP
A file \s-1URL\s0 can have the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        file:<filename>
.Ve
.PP
where \fIfilename\fR is the path of the file to read.
.PP
An \s-1URL\s0 that does not have a protocol prefix will be assumed to be a
file \s-1URL.\s0 Depending on the build, an \s-1URL\s0 that looks like a Windows
path with the drive letter at the beginning will also be assumed to be
a file \s-1URL\s0 (usually not the case in builds for unix-like systems).
.PP
For example to read from a file \fIinput.mpeg\fR with \fBffmpeg\fR
use the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg
.Ve
.PP
This protocol accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBtruncate\fR" 4
.IX Item "truncate"
Truncate existing files on write, if set to 1. A value of 0 prevents
truncating. Default value is 1.
.IP "\fBblocksize\fR" 4
.IX Item "blocksize"
Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
\&\f(CW\*(C`INT_MAX\*(C'\fR, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable for files on slow medium.
.IP "\fBfollow\fR" 4
.IX Item "follow"
If set to 1, the protocol will retry reading at the end of the file, allowing
reading files that still are being written. In order for this to terminate,
you either need to use the rw_timeout option, or use the interrupt callback
(for \s-1API\s0 users).
.IP "\fBseekable\fR" 4
.IX Item "seekable"
Controls if seekability is advertised on the file. 0 means non-seekable, \-1
means auto (seekable for normal files, non-seekable for named pipes).
.Sp
Many demuxers handle seekable and non-seekable resources differently,
overriding this might speed up opening certain files at the cost of losing some
features (e.g. accurate seeking).
.SS "ftp"
.IX Subsection "ftp"
\&\s-1FTP\s0 (File Transfer Protocol).
.PP
Read from or write to remote resources using \s-1FTP\s0 protocol.
.PP
Following syntax is required.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ftp://[user[:password]@]server[:port]/path/to/remote/resource.mpeg
.Ve
.PP
This protocol accepts the following options.
.IP "\fBtimeout\fR" 4
.IX Item "timeout"
Set timeout in microseconds of socket I/O operations used by the underlying low level
operation. By default it is set to \-1, which means that the timeout is
not specified.
.IP "\fBftp-user\fR" 4
.IX Item "ftp-user"
Set a user to be used for authenticating to the \s-1FTP\s0 server. This is overridden by the
user in the \s-1FTP URL.\s0
.IP "\fBftp-password\fR" 4
.IX Item "ftp-password"
Set a password to be used for authenticating to the \s-1FTP\s0 server. This is overridden by
the password in the \s-1FTP URL,\s0 or by \fBftp-anonymous-password\fR if no user is set.
.IP "\fBftp-anonymous-password\fR" 4
.IX Item "ftp-anonymous-password"
Password used when login as anonymous user. Typically an e\-mail address
should be used.
.IP "\fBftp-write-seekable\fR" 4
.IX Item "ftp-write-seekable"
Control seekability of connection during encoding. If set to 1 the
resource is supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not
to be seekable. Default value is 0.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 Protocol can be used as output, but it is recommended to not do
it, unless special care is taken (tests, customized server configuration
etc.). Different \s-1FTP\s0 servers behave in different way during seek
operation. ff* tools may produce incomplete content due to server limitations.
.SS "gopher"
.IX Subsection "gopher"
Gopher protocol.
.SS "gophers"
.IX Subsection "gophers"
Gophers protocol.
.PP
The Gopher protocol with \s-1TLS\s0 encapsulation.
.SS "hls"
.IX Subsection "hls"
Read Apple \s-1HTTP\s0 Live Streaming compliant segmented stream as
a uniform one. The M3U8 playlists describing the segments can be
remote \s-1HTTP\s0 resources or local files, accessed using the standard
file protocol.
The nested protocol is declared by specifying
"+\fIproto\fR" after the hls \s-1URI\s0 scheme name, where \fIproto\fR
is either \*(L"file\*(R" or \*(L"http\*(R".
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        hls+http://host/path/to/remote/resource.m3u8
\&        hls+file://path/to/local/resource.m3u8
.Ve
.PP
Using this protocol is discouraged \- the hls demuxer should work
just as well (if not, please report the issues) and is more complete.
To use the hls demuxer instead, simply use the direct URLs to the
m3u8 files.
.SS "http"
.IX Subsection "http"
\&\s-1HTTP\s0 (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).
.PP
This protocol accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBseekable\fR" 4
.IX Item "seekable"
Control seekability of connection. If set to 1 the resource is
supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not to be seekable,
if set to \-1 it will try to autodetect if it is seekable. Default
value is \-1.
.IP "\fBchunked_post\fR" 4
.IX Item "chunked_post"
If set to 1 use chunked Transfer-Encoding for posts, default is 1.
.IP "\fBcontent_type\fR" 4
.IX Item "content_type"
Set a specific content type for the \s-1POST\s0 messages or for listen mode.
.IP "\fBhttp_proxy\fR" 4
.IX Item "http_proxy"
set \s-1HTTP\s0 proxy to tunnel through e.g. http://example.com:1234
.IP "\fBheaders\fR" 4
.IX Item "headers"
Set custom \s-1HTTP\s0 headers, can override built in default headers. The
value must be a string encoding the headers.
.IP "\fBmultiple_requests\fR" 4
.IX Item "multiple_requests"
Use persistent connections if set to 1, default is 0.
.IP "\fBpost_data\fR" 4
.IX Item "post_data"
Set custom \s-1HTTP\s0 post data.
.IP "\fBreferer\fR" 4
.IX Item "referer"
Set the Referer header. Include 'Referer: \s-1URL\s0' header in \s-1HTTP\s0 request.
.IP "\fBuser_agent\fR" 4
.IX Item "user_agent"
Override the User-Agent header. If not specified the protocol will use a
string describing the libavformat build. (\*(L"Lavf/<version>\*(R")
.IP "\fBreconnect_at_eof\fR" 4
.IX Item "reconnect_at_eof"
If set then eof is treated like an error and causes reconnection, this is useful
for live / endless streams.
.IP "\fBreconnect_streamed\fR" 4
.IX Item "reconnect_streamed"
If set then even streamed/non seekable streams will be reconnected on errors.
.IP "\fBreconnect_on_network_error\fR" 4
.IX Item "reconnect_on_network_error"
Reconnect automatically in case of \s-1TCP/TLS\s0 errors during connect.
.IP "\fBreconnect_on_http_error\fR" 4
.IX Item "reconnect_on_http_error"
A comma separated list of \s-1HTTP\s0 status codes to reconnect on. The list can
include specific status codes (e.g. '503') or the strings '4xx' / '5xx'.
.IP "\fBreconnect_delay_max\fR" 4
.IX Item "reconnect_delay_max"
Sets the maximum delay in seconds after which to give up reconnecting
.IP "\fBmime_type\fR" 4
.IX Item "mime_type"

.IP "\fBhttp_version\fR" 4
.IX Item "http_version"
Exports the \s-1HTTP\s0 response version number. Usually \*(L"1.0\*(R" or \*(L"1.1\*(R".
.IP "\fBicy\fR" 4
.IX Item "icy"
If set to 1 request \s-1ICY\s0 (SHOUTcast) metadata from the server. If the server
supports this, the metadata has to be retrieved by the application by reading
the \fBicy_metadata_headers\fR and \fBicy_metadata_packet\fR options.
The default is 1.
.IP "\fBicy_metadata_headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "icy_metadata_headers"
If the server supports \s-1ICY\s0 metadata, this contains the ICY-specific \s-1HTTP\s0 reply
headers, separated by newline characters.

Choose the \s-1HTTP\s0 authentication type automatically. This is the default.
.IP "\fBbasic\fR" 4
.IX Item "basic"
Choose the \s-1HTTP\s0 basic authentication.
.Sp
Basic authentication sends a Base64\-encoded string that contains a user name and password
for the client. Base64 is not a form of encryption and should be considered the same as
sending the user name and password in clear text (Base64 is a reversible encoding).
If a resource needs to be protected, strongly consider using an authentication scheme
other than basic authentication. \s-1HTTPS/TLS\s0 should be used with basic authentication.
Without these additional security enhancements, basic authentication should not be used
to protect sensitive or valuable information.

calculate maximum sending rate when recovery packets are sent
along with the main media stream:
\&\fBinputbw\fR * (100 + \fBoheadbw\fR) / 100

file mode).
Default is \-1 (automatic), which typically means MPEG-TS;
if you are going to use \s-1SRT\s0
to send any different kind of payload, such as, for example,
wrapping a live stream in very small frames, then you can
use a bigger maximum frame size, though not greater than

Not required on receiver (set to 0),
key size obtained from sender in HaiCrypt handshake.
Default value is 0.
.IP "\fBrcvlatency=\fR\fImicroseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "rcvlatency=microseconds"
The time that should elapse since the moment when the
packet was sent and the moment when it's delivered to
the receiver application in the receiving function.
This time should be a buffer time large enough to cover
the time spent for sending, unexpectedly extended \s-1RTT\s0
time, and the time needed to retransmit the lost \s-1UDP\s0
packet. The effective latency value will be the maximum
of this options' value and the value of \fBpeerlatency\fR
set by the peer side. Before version 1.3.0 this option
is only available as \fBlatency\fR.

.IX Item "timeout=microseconds"
Set raise error timeouts for read, write and connect operations. Note that the

value set here is only a cap on those.
.IP "\fBtlpktdrop=\fR\fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "tlpktdrop=1|0"
Too-late Packet Drop. When enabled on receiver, it skips
missing packets that have not been delivered in time and
delivers the following packets to the application when
their time-to-play has come. It also sends a fake \s-1ACK\s0 to
the sender. When enabled on sender and enabled on the
receiving peer, the sender drops the older packets that
have no chance of being delivered in time. It was
automatically enabled in the sender if the receiver
supports it.

Set receive buffer size, expressed in bytes.
.Sp
Receive buffer must not be greater than \fBffs\fR.
.IP "\fBlossmaxttl=\fR\fIpackets\fR" 4
.IX Item "lossmaxttl=packets"
The value up to which the Reorder Tolerance may grow. When
Reorder Tolerance is > 0, then packet loss report is delayed
until that number of packets come in. Reorder Tolerance
increases every time a \*(L"belated\*(R" packet has come, but it
wasn't due to retransmission (that is, when \s-1UDP\s0 packets tend
to come out of order), with the difference between the latest
sequence and this packet's sequence, and not more than the
value of this option. By default it's 0, which means that this
mechanism is turned off, and the loss report is always sent
immediately upon experiencing a \*(L"gap\*(R" in sequences.
.IP "\fBminversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "minversion"
The minimum \s-1SRT\s0 version that is required from the peer. A connection
to a peer that does not satisfy the minimum version requirement
will be rejected.

A string limited to 512 characters that can be set on the socket prior
to connecting. This stream \s-1ID\s0 will be able to be retrieved by the
listener side from the socket that is returned from srt_accept and
was connected by a socket with that set stream \s-1ID. SRT\s0 does not enforce
any special interpretation of the contents of this string.
This option doesnXt make sense in Rendezvous connection; the result
might be that simply one side will override the value from the other
side and itXs the matter of luck which one would win
.IP "\fBsrt_streamid=\fR\fIstring\fR" 4

When set, this socket uses the Message \s-1API,\s0 otherwise it uses Buffer
\&\s-1API.\s0 Note that in live mode (see \fBtranstype\fR) thereXs only
message \s-1API\s0 available. In File mode you can chose to use one of two modes:
.Sp
Stream \s-1API\s0 (default, when this option is false). In this mode you may
send as many data as you wish with one sending instruction, or even use
dedicated functions that read directly from a file. The internal facility
will take care of any speed and congestion control. When receiving, you
can also receive as many data as desired, the data not extracted will be
waiting for the next call. There is no boundary between data portions in
the Stream mode.
.Sp
Message \s-1API.\s0 In this mode your single sending instruction passes exactly
one piece of data that has boundaries (a message). Contrary to Live mode,
this message may span across multiple \s-1UDP\s0 packets and the only size
limitation is that it shall fit as a whole in the sending buffer. The
receiver shall use as large buffer as necessary to receive the message,
otherwise the message will not be given up. When the message is not
complete (not all packets received or there was a packet loss) it will
not be given up.
.IP "\fBtranstype=\fR\fIlive|file\fR" 4

for a particular transmission type.
.Sp
live: Set options as for live transmission. In this mode, you should
send by one sending instruction only so many data that fit in one \s-1UDP\s0 packet,
and limited to the value defined first in \fBpayload_size\fR (1316 is
default in this mode). There is no speed control in this mode, only the
bandwidth control, if configured, in order to not exceed the bandwidth with
the overhead transmission (retransmitted and control packets).
.Sp
file: Set options as for non-live transmission. See \fBmessageapi\fR
for further explanations
.IP "\fBlinger=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "linger=seconds"
The number of seconds that the socket waits for unsent data when closing.
Default is \-1. \-1 means auto (off with 0 seconds in live mode, on with 180
seconds in file mode). The range for this option is integers in the
0 \- \f(CW\*(C`INT_MAX\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBtsbpd=\fR\fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "tsbpd=1|0"
When true, use Timestamp-based Packet Delivery mode. The default behavior
depends on the transmission type: enabled in live mode, disabled in file
mode.

.IP "\fBca_file, cafile=\fR\fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "ca_file, cafile=filename"
A file containing certificate authority (\s-1CA\s0) root certificates to treat
as trusted. If the linked \s-1TLS\s0 library contains a default this might not
need to be specified for verification to work, but not all libraries and
setups have defaults built in.
The file must be in OpenSSL \s-1PEM\s0 format.
.IP "\fBtls_verify=\fR\fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "tls_verify=1|0"
If enabled, try to verify the peer that we are communicating with.
Note, if using OpenSSL, this currently only makes sure that the
peer certificate is signed by one of the root certificates in the \s-1CA\s0
database, but it does not validate that the certificate actually
matches the host name we are trying to connect to. (With other backends,
the host name is validated as well.)
.Sp
This is disabled by default since it requires a \s-1CA\s0 database to be
provided by the caller in many cases.
.IP "\fBcert_file, cert=\fR\fIfilename\fR" 4

In case threading is enabled on the system, a circular buffer is used
to store the incoming data, which allows one to reduce loss of data due to
\&\s-1UDP\s0 socket buffer overruns. The \fIfifo_size\fR and
\&\fIoverrun_nonfatal\fR options are related to this buffer.
.PP
The list of supported options follows.
.IP "\fBbuffer_size=\fR\fIsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "buffer_size=size"
Set the \s-1UDP\s0 maximum socket buffer size in bytes. This is used to set either
the receive or send buffer size, depending on what the socket is used for.
Default is 32 \s-1KB\s0 for output, 384 \s-1KB\s0 for input.  See also \fIfifo_size\fR.
.IP "\fBbitrate=\fR\fIbitrate\fR" 4
.IX Item "bitrate=bitrate"

Local \s-1IP\s0 address of a network interface used for sending packets or joining
multicast groups.
.IP "\fBpkt_size=\fR\fIsize\fR" 4

Set the size in bytes of \s-1UDP\s0 packets.
.IP "\fBreuse=\fR\fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "reuse=1|0"
Explicitly allow or disallow reusing \s-1UDP\s0 sockets.
.IP "\fBttl=\fR\fIttl\fR" 4
.IX Item "ttl=ttl"
Set the time to live value (for multicast only).
.IP "\fBconnect=\fR\fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "connect=1|0"
Initialize the \s-1UDP\s0 socket with \f(CW\*(C`connect()\*(C'\fR. In this case, the
destination address can't be changed with ff_udp_set_remote_url later.
If the destination address isn't known at the start, this option can
be specified in ff_udp_set_remote_url, too.
This allows finding out the source address for the packets with getsockname,
and makes writes return with \s-1AVERROR\s0(\s-1ECONNREFUSED\s0) if \*(L"destination
unreachable\*(R" is received.
For receiving, this gives the benefit of only receiving packets from
the specified peer address/port.
.IP "\fBsources=\fR\fIaddress\fR\fB[,\fR\fIaddress\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "sources=address[,address]"
Only receive packets sent from the specified addresses. In case of multicast,
also subscribe to multicast traffic coming from these addresses only.
.IP "\fBblock=\fR\fIaddress\fR\fB[,\fR\fIaddress\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "block=address[,address]"
Ignore packets sent from the specified addresses. In case of multicast, also
exclude the source addresses in the multicast subscription.
.IP "\fBfifo_size=\fR\fIunits\fR" 4
.IX Item "fifo_size=units"
Set the \s-1UDP\s0 receiving circular buffer size, expressed as a number of
packets with size of 188 bytes. If not specified defaults to 7*4096.
.IP "\fBoverrun_nonfatal=\fR\fI1|0\fR" 4

.SS "zmq"
.IX Subsection "zmq"
ZeroMQ asynchronous messaging using the libzmq library.
.PP
This library supports unicast streaming to multiple clients without relying on
an external server.
.PP
The required syntax for streaming or connecting to a stream is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        zmq:tcp://ip\-address:port
.Ve
.PP
Example:
Create a localhost stream on port 5555:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-re \-i input \-f mpegts zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
.Ve
.PP
Multiple clients may connect to the stream using:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffplay zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
.Ve
.PP
Streaming to multiple clients is implemented using a ZeroMQ Pub-Sub pattern.
The server side binds to a port and publishes data. Clients connect to the
server (via \s-1IP\s0 address/port) and subscribe to the stream. The order in which
the server and client start generally does not matter.
.PP
ffmpeg must be compiled with the \-\-enable\-libzmq option to support
this protocol.
.PP
Options can be set on the \fBffmpeg\fR/\fBffplay\fR command
line. The following options are supported:
.IP "\fBpkt_size\fR" 4
.IX Item "pkt_size"
Forces the maximum packet size for sending/receiving data. The default value is
131,072 bytes. On the server side, this sets the maximum size of sent packets
via ZeroMQ. On the clients, it sets an internal buffer size for receiving
packets. Note that pkt_size on the clients should be equal to or greater than
pkt_size on the server. Otherwise the received message may be truncated causing
decoding errors.
