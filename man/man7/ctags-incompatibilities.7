.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This page describes major incompatible changes introduced to
Universal\-ctags forked from Exuberant\-ctags.
.SH INCOMPATIBILITIES IN COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
.SS The order of application of patterns and extensions in \fB\-\-langmap\fP
.sp
When applying mappings for a name of given source file,
Exuberant\-ctags tests file name patterns AFTER file extensions
(\fBe\-map\-order\fP). Universal\-ctags does this differently; it tests file
name patterns BEFORE file extensions (\fBu\-map\-order\fP).
.sp
This incompatible change is introduced to deal with the following
situation:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
"build.xml" as a source file,
.IP \(bu 2
The "Ant" parser declares it handles a file name pattern "build.xml", and
.IP \(bu 2
The "XML" parser declares it handles a file extension "xml".
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Which parser should be used for parsing "build.xml"?  The assumption
of Universal\-ctags is the user may want to use the "Ant" parser; the
file name pattern it declares is more specific than the file extension
that the "XML" parser declares. However, e\-map\-order chooses the "XML"
parser.
.sp
So Universal\-ctags uses the u\-map\-order even though it introduces an
incompatibility.
.sp
\fB\-\-list\-map\-extensions=language\fP and \fB\-\-list\-map\-patterns=language\fP
options are helpful to verify and the file extensions and the file
name patterns of given \fIlanguage\fP\&.
.SS Remove \fB\-\-file\-tags\fP and \fB\-\-file\-scope\fP options
.sp
Even in Exuberant\-ctags, "\-\-file\-tags" is not documented in its man page.
Instead of specifying "\-\-file\-tags" or "\-\-file\-tags=yes", use
"\-\-extras=+f" or "\-\-extras=+{inputFile}".
.sp
Instead of specifying "\-\-file\-tags=no", use
"\-\-extras=\-f" or "\-\-extras=\-{inputFile}".
.sp
Universal\-ctags introduces "F/fileScope" extra as the replacement for
\fB\-\-file\-scope\fP option.
.sp
Instead of specifying "\-\-file\-tags" or "\-\-file\-tags=yes", use
"\-\-extras=+F" or "\-\-extras=+{fileScope}".
.sp
Instead of specifying "\-\-file\-tags=no", use
"\-\-extras=\-F" or "\-\-extras=\-{fileScope}".
.SS Language and kind definitions
.SS Language name defined with \fB\-\-langdef=name\fP option
.sp
The characters you can use are more restricted than Exuberant\-ctags.
For more details, see the description of \fB\-\-langdef=name\fP in ctags\-optlib(7).
.SS Obsoleting \fB\-\-<LANG>\-kinds\fP option
.sp
Some options have \fI<LANG>\fP as parameterized parts in their name like
\fB\-\-foo\-<LANG>=...\fP or \fB\-\-<LANG>\-foo=...\fP\&. The most of all such
options in Exuberant\-ctags have the former form, \fB\-\-foo\-<LANG>=...\fP\&.
The exception is \fB\-\-<LANG>\-kinds\fP\&.
.sp
Universal\-ctags uses the former form for all \fI<LANG>\fP parameterized
option. Use \fB\-\-kinds\-<LANG>\fP instead of \fB\-\-<LANG>\-kinds\fP in
Universal\-ctags. \fB\-\-<LANG>\-kinds\fP still works but it will be
removed in the future.
.sp
The former form may be friendly to shell completion engines.
.SS Disallowing to define a kind with "file" as name
.sp
The kind name "file" is reserved.  Using it as part of kind spec in
\fB\-\-regex\-<LANG>\fP option is now disallowed.
.SS Disallowing to define a kind with "F" as letter
.sp
The kind letter "F" is reserved.  Using it as part of a kind spec in
\fB\-\-regex\-<LANG>\fP option is now disallowed.
.SS Disallowing to use other than alphabetical character as kind letter
.sp
Exuberant\-ctags accepts a character other than alphabetical character
as kind letter in \fB\-\-regex\-<LANG>=...\fP option.  Universal\-ctags
accepts only an alphabetical character.
.SS Acceptable characters as parts of a kind name
.sp
Exuberant\-ctags accepts any character as a part of a kind name
defined with \fB\-\-regex\-<LANG>=/regex/replacement/kind\-spec/\fP\&.
.sp
Universal\-ctags accepts only an alphabetical character as
the initial letter of a kind name.
Universal\-ctags accepts only an alphabetical character or
numerical character as the rest letters.
.sp
An example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-regex\-Foo=/abstract +class +([a\-z]+)/\e1/a,abstract class/i
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Universal\-ctags rejects this because the kind name, "abstract class",
includes a whitespace character.
.sp
This requirement is for making the output of Universal\-ctags follow
the tags file format.
.SS A combination of a kind letter and a kind name
.sp
In Universal\-ctags, the combination of
a kind letter and a kind name must be unique in a language.
.sp
You cannot define more than one kind reusing a kind letter with
different kind names. You cannot define more than one kind reusing a
kind name with different kind letters.
.sp
An example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-regex\-Foo=/abstract +class +([a\-z]+)/\e1/a,abstractClass/i
\-\-regex\-Foo=/attribute +([a\-z]+)/\e1/a,attribute/i
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Universal\-ctags rejects this because the kind letter, "a", used twice
for defining a kind "abstractClass" and "attribute".
.SH INCOMPATIBILITIES IN TAGS FILE FORMAT
.SS Using numerical character in the name part of tag tagfield
.sp
The version 2 tags file format, the default output format of
Exuberant\-ctags, accepts only alphabetical characters in the name part
of tag tagfield.
.sp
Universal\-ctags introduces an exception to this specification; it may
use numerical characters in addition to alphabetical characters as the
letters other than initial letter of the name part.
.sp
The kinds "heading1", "heading2", and "heading3" in the HTML parser
are the examples.
.SS Truncating the pattern for long input lines
.sp
To prevent generating overly large tags files, a pattern field is
truncated, by default, when its size exceeds 96 bytes. A different
limit can be specified with \fB\-\-pattern\-length\-limit=N\fP\&. Specifying
0 as \fIN\fP results no truncation as Exuberant\-ctags does not.
.SH OPTION FILES LOADING AT STARTING UP TIME (PRELOAD FILES)
.sp
File paths for preload files are changed.
Universal\-ctags doesn\(aqt load "~/.ctags" at starting up time.
See "FILES" section of ctags(1).
.SH KIND LETTERS AND NAMES
.sp
A kind letter "F" and a kind name "file" are reserved in the
main part. A parser cannot have a kind conflicting with
these reserved ones. Some incompatible changes are introduced
to follow the above rule.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Cobol\(aqs "file" kind is renamed to "fileDesc" because the
kind name "file" is reserved.
.IP \(bu 2
Ruby\(aqs "F" (singletonMethod) is changed to "S".
.IP \(bu 2
SQL\(aqs "F" (field) is changed to "E".
